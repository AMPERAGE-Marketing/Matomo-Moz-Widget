# Matomo (formerly Piwik) Moz Widget by Amperage

## Description

Show Moz.com info for the current site as a dashboard widget. First, you specify your Moz.com API keys in your user settings, and then your dashboard widget will check which site's being viewed and display info for that site. Additionally/alternatively, you can provide the URL to view your latest Moz Pro Campaign Custom Report, if available, to be shown in the widget for the specified site.

## Installation

Install it via Matomo (formerly Piwik) Marketplace or by manually uploading the MozWidgetByAmperage folder to the plugins folder.
